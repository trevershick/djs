NAME
====
**djs** - download files from Jenkins

SYNOPSIS
========
| **djs** [**-nhqVv**] [**-u** url] [**-e** path] [**-b** base] [**-j** build] [**-d** destination] [**-p** project] [**-s** solution] [**-S** solution_filter] [**-D** _destination-template_]

DESCRIPTION
===========
This manual page describes the **djs** utility.  It has been built to work with Jenkins when using the **Folders** plugin and expects a hierarchical folder setup like:

**/Base/Project/Branch**

**Base** can contain zero or more elements like **/MyCorp/job/GroupA**.

**djs** strings together the parameters provided to form API requests to Jenkins to locate builds and artifacts.  If you have a non-standard (from djs' perspective) it might take a little experimentation to get your setup configured correctly.

It's easy to do this using the **-n**(dry-run) and **-v**(verbose) options on the command line.  Once you've determined what your proper and path are, add them to your _~/.djsrc_ file in the following fashion:

```
url = "http://myjenkins.server:8080"
base = "job/MyTopLevel"
```

Once they're in _~/.djsrc_ you'll not need to set them again.  You can also specify the **--branch** and **--project** and **--build** if you want but if you execute **djs** from within a local _git_ repo, it will _guess_ setting **project** to the current git project directory and **branch** to the current _git_ branch.  It will also default **build** to _lastSuccessfulBuild_ and utilizing the configuration it already has, it will interrogate Jenkins for the actual build number.  The only thing left to do is to specify the file name to download via **--solution**.  It is a common pattern to specify solution in the _git_ project repository in the following fashion:

```
solution = "myfile.xml"
```

Once this is set, **djs** will combine **./.djsrc** with the settings in **~/.djsrc** and any command line options to form a full artifact download URL and it will proceed to download the file and save it in **--destination**.

FLAGS
-----
-n, --dry-run
:   If set to true, nothing will be downloaded.

-h, --help
:   Prints help information

-q, --quiet
:   Turns off output

-V, --version
:   Prints version information

-v, --verbose
:   If set to true, extra information will be sent to the console

OPTIONS
-------
-u, -\-url _jenkins-url_
:   Use _jenkins-url_ to contact the Jenkins server.  This should NOT include any trailing slashes.  An example of this is _http://myjenkins.com:8080_

-e, -\-base _path_
:   Use _path_ as the base path which is appended onto the _jenkins-url_ which forms the first part of the full Jenkins URLs used to interrogate Jenkins for build information and download files (ex. if _path_=**job/MyCorp** http://jenkins.com/**job/MyCorp**/job/Project/job/...)

-p, -\-project _project_
:   Use _project_ in the Jenkins URL paths (ex. _project_=**MyProject** http://jenkins.com/BasePath/job/**MyProject**/job/...)

-b, -\-branch _branch_
:   Use _branch_ to locate the artifact.  This is used in the construction of the URLs used to interrogate Jenkins (ex. if _branch_=x, http://jenkins.com/BasePath/job/Project/job/**x**/...)

-j, -\-build _build-specifier_
:   Use _build-specifier_ to locate the job from which to download artifacts.  _build-specifier_ may be a number or any of the following symbolic specifiers:

    **lastSuccessfulBuild** - interrogate Jenkins for the last successful build of the given _branch_ and _project_.  Once resolved, the _build_ will be internally updated to that build number.

    **lastKeepForever** - locate the last build that is being 'kept forever'

    **latest** - the latest build failure or not

-s, -\-solution _solution_
:   Specifies the file to locate in Jenkins and download (ex. MySolution.xml)

-S, -\-solution-filter _filter_
:   Use _filter_ to disambiguate between artifacts in Jenkins.  If more than one _solution_ exists in the artifacts of the specific _build_ then the relative path of the artifact will be inspected to find a match for _filter_.

-d, -\-destination _destination_
:   Use _destination_ as the location to which files should be downloaded.  If the location is not a directory then it's taken to be a file name and the artifact will be downloaded to _destination_ irrespective of the artifact name, build, branch or any other information.

-D, -\-destination-template _template_
:   Use _template_ to format the output filename.  See the **Destination Template** section.

Destination Path
----------------
By default djs will download your file to the current directory unless otherwise specified by ```destination``` or ```-d``` which can be either a directory or a filename.
If ```destination``` points to a directory then djs will rename the downloaded file with the following template:

```
  {project}-{branch}-{build}.{extension} #yields myproj-mybranch-15.xml
```

or if your branch name "djs-123" contains the project name "djs" then

```
  {branch}-{build}.{extension} #yields djs-15.xml

```

You can customize this via the ```destination_template``` configuration value in your .djsrc file or via the ```-D``` command line option.  The value is a string that contains
format specifiers. Examples are shown below.

```
  {project}-{solution_basename}-{solution_filter}-{branch}-{build}-{build_abbreviation}.{solution_extension}
  #yields
  ./proj1-solution-filter1-branch1-latest-lt.txt"
```

Format Specifiers
-----------------

All format specifiers come in three flavors. Lowercase, Uppercase and Preserve Case.  Shown below are the output values for various specifiers and the input value "Project1".

Input        | Format        | Output
------------ | ------------- | ----------------
Project1     | project       | project1
Project1     | Project       | Project1
Project1     | PROJECT       | PROJECT1

**All Specifiers**

All the specifiers below are available in the three variants mentioned above, Lowercase, Uppercase and Preserve Case

Specifier            | Example Value
-------------------- | --------------------------
project              | project1
solution             | myfile.xml
solution_basename    | myfile
solution_extension   | xml
solution_filter      | build-test
branch               | 1_fix_caps
branch_nums          | 1
branch_alphas        | fixcaps
build                | 15
build_abbreviation   | ls (ls=lastSuccessfulBuild, lt=latest, kf=lastKeepForever)
